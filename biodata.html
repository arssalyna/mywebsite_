    <h3> Educational background </h3>

    <p> I started my learning journey when I was 5 years old. I am in kindergarten at Sekolah Kebangsaan Chembong until 6 years old. Then I continued learning at the same school until I was 12 years old.
        After I finished with UPSR, I continued school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Dato' Sedia Raja. I am a first class student from form 1 to form 3.
        When I was in form 4, I was less interested in pure science subjects, so I took additional accounting, economics and mathematics streams until I was in form 5 and finished SPM.
        After I finished SPM, I tried to apply to continue my studies to a higher level which is a diploma. Universiti Teknologi Mara is my first choice because it is my dream university. Because of fortune, I have now successfully continued my studies in the Information Management course.
